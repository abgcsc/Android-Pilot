\section{Deliverables}

The deliverables include the Eclipse project export and the necessary modifications to the {\tt SoundAnalyzer}, \verb=TunerActivity=, and \verb=Complex= classes. 
Along with these changes, you must also create your own class that implements a musical scale and provides labels and frequencies for all possible notes.
Your program, at the minimum, should be capable of identifying the correct note when confronted with a pure tone.
