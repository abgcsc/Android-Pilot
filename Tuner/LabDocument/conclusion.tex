\section{Conclusion}

This activity should test all you have learned so far in this class.  
Youâ€™ve learned much about programming in Java: loops, arrays, control statements, API calls and many other concepts.  
After having completed this lab, you should understand sound a little better in terms of pitch and have an even greater understanding of many of the things you have already learned and how they interact.
