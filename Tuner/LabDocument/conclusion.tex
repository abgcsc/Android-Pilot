\section{Conclusion}

This activity should test all that you have learned so far in this class.  
You have learned much about programming in Java: loops, arrays, control statements, API calls and other concepts.  
After completing this lab, you should understand sound a bit better in terms of pitch and have an even greater understanding of how different programming paradigms interact.
