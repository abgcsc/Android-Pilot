\section{Activity}

\begin{enumerate}
	

\item Create two different subclasses of animal class and name them Wolf and Lion.

\item Provide the implementation for abstract methods of Animal class in Wolf and Lion classes.
	
\item Create two subclasses of Wolf named Coyote and Hayne and two subclasses of Lion named Cougar and Leopard.
	
\item Call the super class constructor and pass "Context" type as its argument because the Animal (parent) class takes Context type as an argument 	   and the Wolf and Lion class constructor also takes "Context" type as an argument.

\item Set the instance variable (name) of Animal class in all of Animals subclasses.

\item Override the methods of Wolf and Lion in its child classes so that it would produce different sounds when clicked on different picture 	     choices.

\item In Animal activity class, use polymorphism to initialize the Animal array.

\end{enumerate}
