For this lab, you will be using the MediaPlayer and MediaRecorder classes. These classes contain methods that utilize the Android's microphone and speakers to play and record media. Before you begin the activity, visit \textit{http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer.html} and \textit{http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaRecorder.html}. Familiarize yourself with both of these classes and their methods.
