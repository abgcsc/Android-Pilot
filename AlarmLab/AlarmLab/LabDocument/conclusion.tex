\section{Conclusion}

In this lab, you have learned the concept of using APIs. This was done through extensively researching the \verb=MediaPlayer= and \verb=MediaRecorder= libraries, and then using their methods to implement an alarm system. In the future, you should be able to research other libraries in an API to accomplish other programming projects.
