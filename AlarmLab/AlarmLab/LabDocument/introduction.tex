\section{Introduction}

In this lab, you will be creating an alarm system, which will detect sound above a certain amplitude. If sound is detected, an alarm will be activated. In addition to listening for sound, the alarm can also be sounded at any point for testing by the user. In order to accomplish this on Android, you must utilize its onboard microphone and analyze the amplitude of the incoming audio data. This will be done by using classes and methods from APIs.
