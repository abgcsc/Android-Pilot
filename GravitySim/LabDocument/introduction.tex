\section{Introduction}

In this lab, you will create a gravity simulator.
The screen displays an explanse where the user can create planets by touching the screen.
These planets have mass and therefore gravitate towards other planets and pull other planets towards themselves with their gravity.
When planets collide, they form larger planets.
Other features may include an increase in planet size depending on how long touch is held down and the ability to sling already created planets.
