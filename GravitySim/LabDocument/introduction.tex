\section{Introduction}

In this lab, you will create a gravity simulator.
The simulator will respond to user touch events in order to create planets of varying size and exude limited control over their motion.
You will accomplish this by designing a GUI layout, handling touch events initiated by the user, and rendering the planets.
A custom GUI element will be provided to aid the touch event handling and animation rendering.
