\section{Activity}

The lab requires you build a GUI from scratch.
There are many ways to go about this, but perhaps the most logical is to start by creating the screen which displays the space where the planets will be created and moved about.
After the display is set up, methods that allow planet creation and define the planets qualities should be made.
Last, the methods that simulate the movement/merging of the planets due to their mass and relative gravity are needed.
There should also be a button to start the movement of the planets (planets can be made before start is pressed and gravity is taken into effect), a button to pause the movement and a button to lock/unlock the screen (prevent or allow touch events).
