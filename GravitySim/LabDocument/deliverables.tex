\section{Deliverables}

Deliverables include a project export from Eclipse.
When running, the simulator should create, move, and grow planets according to user touch events only if the screen is unlocked.
Planets should only move under their own influence when the simulator is playing.
Pausing should not prevent touch events, and upon resuming behavior should be as though the pause never occurred.
