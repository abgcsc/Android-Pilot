\section{Introduction}
This lab is designed to reinforce two of the topics covered in CSC120: arrays and loops. You will add your own code that effectively implements both of these topics in certain sections in the provided source code. The code you create will go in a source file called {\tt PlayATune.java} and will be used by another source file called {\tt PlayATuneHelper.java}.  Note that you will not have to edit this second file.
