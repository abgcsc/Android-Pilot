\section{Objective}

In this lab, you will learn how to utilize and implement a Graphical User Interface or GUI. Most all applications use a GUI because they are more intuitive and sometimes easier to use than a command line interface. You will be supplied with a non operational GUI application to which you must add the necessary functionality to each button. You are highly encouraged, and will possibly be graded, to enhace the visual aesthetics of this application to make it more user friendly and appealing. As is, it uses a basic design layout and does not rotate to landscape mode. Any modifications to the GUI must be done via the text version and not the drag and drop option. By the end of this lab, you will be able to implement your own GUI application without any assistance.
