\section{Objective}

In this lab you will take the finished code from Calculator I and use recursion to implement order of operations and a few mathematical operations that are well suited for recursion.  Such operations include square root and greatest common denominator.  This lab will also take advantage of clever use of a basic data structure to implement a complex operation.  Order of operations will be implemented by recursively creating stacks.
