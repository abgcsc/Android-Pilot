\section{Activity}

These functions must be implemented manually:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Numbers 0 through 9
\item Addition
\item Subtraction
\item Multiplication
\item Division
\item Equals/Evaluate
\item Negative
\item Decimal
\item Backspace (delete the last added digit)
\item Clear All
\end{enumerate}

These functions should be done with the use of a Java or Android specific API:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Square Root
\item Inverse
\item Percent
\end{enumerate}

To make the buttons of the calculator function you must implement an anonymous inner class that listens for button presses.  Anonymous inner classes are classes that are declared and instantiated in the middle of an expression.  Because they are only called when triggered by a certain event, ex. the number 8 key is pressed, they do not need a named reference.  By doing this the programmer can link specific code to specific GUI elements, such that each GUI element has its own function.  More information about anonymous inner classes can be readily found on the web and Oracle's Java documentation.
