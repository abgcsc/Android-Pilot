The functions for the calculator should include at a minimum:

These functions must be implemented manually:
Numbers 0 through 9
Addition
Equals
Minus
Multiplication
Division
Negative
Decimal
Backspace (delete the last added digit)
Clear All

These functions can use an API call if needed:
Square Root
Inverse
Percent

Bonus points may be applied if the calculator can take multiple operators and perform the proper order of operations on the equation after the "Equals" button is pressed.

Remeber, the proper order of operations is:
1. Parantheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication/Division
4. Addition/Subtraction

Exponents are not required in this application, but parantheses are encouraged if order of operations is implemented.
