\section{Introduction}

In this lab, you will be required to take a pre-existing GUI framework for a calculator and add the proper fuctionality to it, such that it behaves as a calculator should. At this point, you should have all the necessary knowledge to implement this calculator. 

The calculator must work like a normal calculator, in that it displays the digits and operations that have been entered. It must also correctly perform the mathematical operations specified in the Activity section of this document. A good example of this can be seen in the existing Android calculator.
