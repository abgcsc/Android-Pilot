\section{Introduction}

In this lab, you will be required to take a pre-existing GUI framework for a calculator and add fuctionality to the calculator. At this point, you should have all the necessary knowledge to implement this calculator. 

The calculator must work like a normal calculator, in that is displays the digits and operations that have been entered. A good example of this can be seen in the existing Android calculator.

One piece of advice that you may need, there must be a class that detects when buttons are pressed. Without this, your application will not do anything when buttons are pressed.
