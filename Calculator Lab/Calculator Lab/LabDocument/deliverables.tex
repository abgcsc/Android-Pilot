%define the criteria for success, including how to turn the lab work in for evaluation
\section{Deliverables}

You are required to turn in your entire project source code as a zip file through the means specified by the teacher. The project must successfully compile into an Android application. If the application does not compile, your project will not be graded. If the application does not run on a phone, it will receive minimal marks. Any function that does not work will result in a loss of points. A force close (crash) will also result in a deduction of points. Any known bugs should be documented in a readme file included with the project. This may allow for a smaller deduction of points depending on how serious the bugs are.
