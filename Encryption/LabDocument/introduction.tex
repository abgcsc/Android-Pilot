\section{Introduction}

In this lab, students will be provided with a “buggy” text encryption application for android to reinforce the concept of exception and error handling techniques. This application will contain a text box in which the students can enter a text string.  After pressing the “Encrypt” button, the text will be show in another box as an encrypted string. By pressing the “Decrypt” button, students will be presented with their original text. The students will have to debug this code and decide where to place try/catch statements in order for the application to work correctly.This lab will demonstrate the importance of error checking/handling in complex code.
