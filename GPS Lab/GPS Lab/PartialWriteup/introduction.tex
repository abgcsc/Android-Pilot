\section{Introduction}

This lab will incorporate all of the topics covered in previous labs. You will create a GPS guided scavenger hunt app that will have you collecting data from Near Field Communications (NFC) chips placed across campus. The NFC sensors will each hold the location of the next sensor to be found. You will build this app from scratch to demonstrate your knowledge of the topics covered in all the previous labs.
