\section{Introduction}
In this lab you will learn about Errors and how to identify them. You will locate and fix Compiler, Linker, and Runtime Errors introduced into the PlayATune lab from previously.
\begin{flushleft}
Compiler Errors are syntactical errors in code. The most common cause of this is a typo.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
Linker Errors are caused when a file or package referenced in one class cannot be located by the compiler.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
Runtime Errors occur when there is a logical error in a program. This can be as simple as forgetting to break a loop, resulting in an infinite loop, or as complex as accessing a memory location beyond that allocated to the program.
