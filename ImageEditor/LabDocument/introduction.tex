\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this lab is to introduce and learn the concept of object interaction. An object consists of data and methods grouped together to form an entity. It also has a sort of "object interface" which consists of methods that define how the object will interact with other objects.

\noindent
For this lab, you will be developing two classes: a Camera and an Image class. The camera capabilities on the Android phone will be utilized. You will be required to code each of these objects in a way that they can interact with each other to accomplish the task of capturing a picture and editing that picture.

\noindent
The Camera class should be able to take a picture with the camera, and then send it to the Image class to be maniplulated by the user.

\noindent
*I will include more detailed information for each class after I am able to program each class successfully and know what each should be capable of.

\noindent
*Different methods used from an API will be included here for the students to research before beginning. After the program is finished I will fill this in. 

\noindent
*A picture of the GUI of the app will also be included.
