\section{Objective}

In this lab, you will develop a camera/image editor app. A picture will be taken with a simple method call, and then the image will be manipulated with different filters. There will be two different classes: CameraActivity and EditActivity. Using different instances of these classes, the concept of object interaction will be learned.
