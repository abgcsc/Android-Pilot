\section{Objective}

In this lab, you will develop a camera/image editor app. A picture will be taken with a simple method call, and then the image will be manipulated with different effects, such as greyscale. There will be two different classes: Camera and Image. Using different objects of these classes, the concept of object interaction will be learned.
