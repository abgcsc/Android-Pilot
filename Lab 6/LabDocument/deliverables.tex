\section{Deliverables}

The deliverable is the source tree which includes the directories bin, gen, libs, res, and src, and the files .classpath, .project, AndroidManifest.xml, proguard.cfg, and project.properties.  This basic structure will be provided to you.  
You will only make changes in the SoundAnalyzer and TunerActivity classes in the /src/csc120/lab6/Tuner directory and complete the Complex class in /src/csc120/lab6/FFT. 
Along with these changes, you must also create your own class which determines the pitch of the sound and the note that the sound makes.
