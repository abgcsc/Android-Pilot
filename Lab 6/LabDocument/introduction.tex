\section{Introduction}

In this lab you will be creating a chromatic tuner, which is a device that tells a user what musical note is closest to the one being played into the tuner's microphone.
In order to accomplish this on Android, you must utilize its onboard microphone and directly analyze the incoming audio data.
Aiding you in this task is a function called the \ac{fft} .
