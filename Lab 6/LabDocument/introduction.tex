\section{Introduction}

In this lab you will be creating a chromatic tuner, which is a device that tells a user what musical note is closest to the one being played into the tuner's microphone.
In order to accomplish this on Android, you must utilize its onboard microphone and directly analyze the incoming audio data.
Aiding you in this task is a function called the \ac{fft}.
The \ac{fft} is a special case of the more general Fourier transform in that the \ac{fft} only applies to discrete data.
The \ac{fft} has various applications, but the one for which it will be used here is to decompose an audio waveform into its constituent frequencies.
A full discussion of the Fourier transform is beyond the scope of this lab and this course, but some examples of it in action will be given.
Please note that these examples are meant to illustrate concepts rather than be perfectly accurate in their results.
Figure~\ref{fig:cft} demonstrates the result of a continuous Fourier transform applied upon a sine wave.

Figure~\ref{fig:dft} on the other hand illustrates the expected results of a discrete Fourier transform applied upon a discretized sine wave.

As you can see, the frequency decomposition is not as well-defined in the discrete case.
